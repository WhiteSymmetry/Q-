#What is quantum computing?

Quantum means the smallest possible discrete unit of any physical property, usually referring to properties of atomic or subatomic particles. Quantum computers use actual quantum particles, artificial atoms, or collective properties of quantum particles as processing units, and are large, complex, and expensive devices.

Harnessing the unique behavior of quantum physics and applying it to computing, quantum computers introduce new concepts to traditional programming methods, making use of quantum physics behaviors such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference.
